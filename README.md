# React Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio built with plain React using `react-scripts`. The application does not rely on Vite, Next.js or TypeScript. All components use the `.js` extension and standard CSS for styling.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build the production assets
- `npm test` – run tests

Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies, then `npm test` to execute the Jest test suite.

The app entry point is `src/index.js` and routing is handled with `react-router-dom`.
